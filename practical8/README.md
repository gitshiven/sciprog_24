This program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two positive integers using both iterative and recursive methods.

## Files

- `main.c`: Contains the implementation of the GCD calculation program.

## How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C compiler installed, such as GCC. You can verify this by running the following command in your terminal:
```sh
gcc --version

# Output
Input two positive integers:
48 18
GCD computed from iterative function for 48 and 18 is: 6
GCD computed from recursive function for 48 and 18 is: 6
