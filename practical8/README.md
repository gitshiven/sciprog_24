# GCD Calculation Using Iterative and Recursive Methods

This program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two positive integers using both iterative and recursive methods.

## Files

- `gdc.c`: Contains the implementation of the GCD calculation program.

## How to Compile and Run
1. **Ensure you have a C compiler** installed, such as GCC.
2. **Open a terminal** in the directory containing `gdc.c`
3. **Compile the code** using the following command:
   ```sh
   gcc -o GDC gdc.c

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C compiler installed, such as GCC. You can verify this by running the following command in your terminal:
```sh
gcc --version

# Output
Input two positive integers:
48 18
GCD computed from iterative function for 48 and 18 is: 6
GCD computed from recursive function for 48 and 18 is: 6
